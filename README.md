## Description
This reference dataset is named ITS2PLANTS, it includes 293,453 ITS2 sequences, downloaded from NCBI GenBank, comprising 133 orders and 564 families within the subkingdom Viridiplantae (Cavalier-Smith, 1981). The ITS2 has already been proposed and widely used as universal barcode marker for plants. This comprehensive, updated (November 21th, 2018) and accurate reference dataset aims at providing a solid reference for ITS-based plant metabarcoding projects, which is of fundamental importance for results standardization. 
The dataset underwent manual identity checks and taxonomic assignment in order to remove misnamed sequences which impair correct taxonomic assignments. The reference dataset was validated and its reliability was tested with an ad hoc mock community and aerobiological samples. Sequences download query, curation and testing steps are carefully described in Banchi et al......................................... 


## Repository content

"DATASET_Viridiplantae.tar.gz" contains the complete dataset (named TOTAL) and its clustered versions (99%, 97%, 95% and 90% identity) in .fasta format, each sequence is provided with taxonomy within the header. Sequences are identified by GeneBank accession number.  

"SEQ_Viridiplantae.tar.gz" and "TAXONOMY_Viridiplantae.tar.gz" archives contain the same datasets in QIIME format, which requires sequences and related taxonomy in two separate files. 

"table_families.pdf" contains Families and orders included in the dataset and total families reported in NCBI.
