## Description
This reference dataset is named ITS2PLANTS, it includes 293,453 ITS2 sequences comprising 133 orders and 564 plant families within the subkingdom Viridiplantae (Cavalier-Smith, 1981). The ITS2 has already been proposed and widely used as universal barcode marker for plants and this comprehensive, updated and accurate reference dataset aims providing a solid reference for ITS based plant metabarcoding projects. 
The dataset underwent manual identity checks and taxonomic assignment in order to remove misnamed sequences that impair correct taxonomic assignments and it will be regularly updated. The reference dataset was validated and its reliability was tested with an ad hoc mock community and aerobiological samples. ITS2PLANTS dataset represents a step step towards standardization of plant DNA metabarcoding.

Families and orders included in the dataset and total families reported in NCBI GenBank are available in:"table_families.pdf".The sequences used to build the database were downloaded on 21th November 2018 from NCBI web portal.

"DATASET_Viridiplantae.tar.gz" contains the complete dataset and its de-replicated versions (99%, 97%, 95%, 90% identity) in .fasta format, each sequence is provided with taxonomy within the sequence header. All sequences are identified by gene  

"SEQ_Viridiplantae.tar.gz" and "TAXONOMY_Viridiplantae.tar.gz" archives contain the same datasets using QIIME2 format which requires sequences and taxonomy in two separate files.
