## Overview
This reference dataset is named ITS2PLANTS, it includes 293,453 sequences comprising 133 plant orders and 564 families within the subkingdom Viridiplantae. Families included in the dataset and total families reported in NCBI are available in the file:"table_families.pdf"







•	DNA metabarcoding combines DNA barcoding with high throughput sequencing (HTS) to identify straightforward different taxa within environmental communities. The ITS2 has already been proposed and widely used as universal barcode marker for plants but a comprehensive, updated and accurate reference dataset of ITS2 plant sequences has not been available so far. 
•	Here we constructed a reference dataset of plant ITS2 sequences including both Chlorophyta and Streptophyta. The ITS2 sequences were retrieved from NCBI, underwent manual identity checks and taxonomic assignment in order to remove misnamed sequences that impair correct taxonomic assignments in a large scale reads annotation analysis. The total reference dataset was also de-replicated at 99%, 97%, 95% and 90% identity to reduce redundancy and computational effort. Finally these marker gene reference databases are formatted for use with QIIME. 
•	This reference dataset is named ITS2PLANTS, it includes 293,453 sequences comprising 133 plant orders. We validated and tested its reliability and functionality with an ad hoc mock community including DNA of seven Chlorophyta and Streptophyta taxa and using three aerobiological samples. ITS2PLANTS was also screened for the presence of the most important allergenic plant taxa.
•	ITS2PLANTS dataset represents a pivotal first step of a general standardization of plant DNA metabarcoding.
